Home assignment for Cellebrite CTO intern candidates

The attached files contain a scrambled image (assignment.jpg). It was divided into square tiles (43x43 pixles). Each tile was rotate by 90 degrees to the left or right (randomly). The tiles were shuffled to a random order and then reassembled to form the scrambled image.
All the information about the scrambling process can be found in the SQLite database (assignment.sqlite). It contains, for every tile, its original position, new position and direction of rotation (left/right).
Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to use the data in the SQLite database to descramble the jpg image.

Please send us the descrambled jpg image with a one paragraph explanation how you did it, including tools and programming languages and libraries you used.
You may also add code you wrote for this assignment.

Good luck
